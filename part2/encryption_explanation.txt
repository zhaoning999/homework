As django-cryptography provides us with transparent encryption on columns on databases, we just apply the encryption to the columns that can be encrypted. The encryption key is derived from SECRET_KEY config, which shouldn't be exposed to anyone other than admin. So the key used to encrypt the databases is not seen by anyone except server program itself, so the key is confidential inside the program.
